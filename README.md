# 🤖 Smart Math Prediction

> **Machine Learning Project - Predicting Student Math Scores**  
> Using Linear Regression with 87.6% accuracy

🌐 **Live Demo**: [https://covu0.github.io/AI-Predict-math-score/](https://covu0.github.io/AI-Predict-math-score/)

## 🎯 What This Project Does

This AI model predicts how well students will perform in math based on their other academic and background information. Perfect for educators who want to identify students who might need extra help!

## 📊 Results Summary

| 🎯 **Metric** | 📈 **Score** |
|---------------|--------------|
| Model Accuracy | **87.6%** |
| Average Error | **±4.21 points** |
| Predictions within ±5 points | **92.4%** |

## 🔍 Key Discoveries

**🏆 Most Important Factors:**
1. **Reading Score** - The biggest predictor of math success
2. **Writing Score** - Second most important factor  
3. **Test Preparation** - Helps, but not as much as you'd think
4. **Parent Education Level** - Has some impact

**💡 Surprising Insight:** Students who are good at reading and writing are almost always good at math too!

## 📚 The Data

- **1,000 students** from real schools
- **8 different factors** analyzed
- **100% complete data** - no missing information
- **Source**: [Kaggle Students Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
